I've converted the HTML to markdown with Pandoc since I couldn't find any
source code for the original book.


# TODO:

- get rid of all sexist, racist, demeaning etc language / examples / pictures
- automate building to an HTML site
- publish somewhere
- choose a new name so it's identifiably different
